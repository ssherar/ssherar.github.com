Hello, and welcome to my new website. I decided to redesign my site again due to moving to the Static site generator: [Jekyll][1]. With this new design I have utilised other tools including [Twitter Bootstrap][2] and a couple of handmade rakefiles which I've written to help me with the deployment of blog posts. If you're iterested in my site, I have published it on my [Github][3]!

I shall be updating this blog more often over the next couple of months with updates on projects I will be getting involved with, with also posts on interesting things happening inmy life!

If your interested in contacting me, you can email me at [my email](mailto:sbsherar@gmail.com), or you can normally find me on either Freenode or AFNet irc servers!
