title: "Big vs Small"
---

This blog post is all about size of laptops and real estate. In my arsenal I have a lot of kit with plenty of desktop "real estate", including a 2 24" monitors on my desktop, and a 17" MacBook Pro which dwarfs any other laptop in its sight!Include an iPad with the 10.1 inches of touch-screen goodness, and we end up with a lot of pixels to play around with!

However, due to an unfortunate accident with my MacBook Pro, it has now been sent off for repair and I've ended up with no laptop, and no way to take notes in lectures! Luckily a friend loaned me a little Lenovo X60 laptop.

Coming from a 17" to a 12" laptop was a surprisingly easy transition, and the laptop is a nifty 1.2GHz Dual Core Intel Processor with a 1GB stick of DDR2 RAM, which is more than enough to do most tasks I need. However, for productivity, it felt like I was producing more work on the smaller screen!

My typical setup on a smaller screen laptop is very standard - [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org), with [XMonad](http://xmonad.org/) as the Window Manager (yes, I'm a haskell lover - please don't shoot me). Normally with most laptops I always have a touch pad, which always _seemed_ quicker, going to X60 with just the Intellipoint Mouse (a.k.a nipple mouse), everything seemed incredibly slow. So I decided to learn all the key bindings. To be honest, it did take a while to get my head around everything; but now I feel like everything is at my fingertips! (God I sound corny...) With the way that XMonad tiles windows, with the lovely addition of DMenu and DBar, this 12" laptop now feels as big as my MacBook - and at half the weight and size!

However, I've found that XMonad only works well on a single screen system, as running it seems quite bodged when running over multiple screens (especially my setup of 3 monitors). So what I run at home on my desktop is a Mix of Cinnamon and [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.com), which works quite well over multiple screens, and great if you don't want to jump head first into learning Haskell!
