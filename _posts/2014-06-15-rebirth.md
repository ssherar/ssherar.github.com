So I guess you're wondering about what I am talking about? Well I've taken the bold step (well not really thanks to @mdo) to redesign my website! Instead of having something bispoke (even with bootstrap), I've gone for something far more cleaner: [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)

Aptly named after the other half of the platform this is running on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), this is a lovely clean style with all the information that I ever want on here!

Also I promise to actualyl post on this atleast once a year - which I failed at over the last 15 months!
