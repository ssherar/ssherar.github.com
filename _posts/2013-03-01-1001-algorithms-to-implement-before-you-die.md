title: "1001 Algorithms to Implement Before You Die"
---

Just yesterday, I stumbled upon a lovely concept written by [Karlisson Bezerra](http://labs.hacktoon.com/src/1001/) about 1001 algorithms to implement before you die. Karlisson has already started on this on his [Github account](http://github.com/karlisson/1001/), but it seems to be out not very active recently.

So I've decided to start a new version in English (or any other language you would prefer to write - I won't discriminate!) as a side project to get more people into open-source projects at [Aberystwyth University](http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs), but everyone is welcome.

####Specifications

There are certain standards and practises which I want to follow in this project to make it standardised:

* The main language will be Python using the [Google Styleguide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html). Over time other languages will be added, such as Haskell and C. Ideally in the end we will have plenty of examples in different types of languages!
* Every algorithm should have a comment block at the start explaining the algorithm and the authors name. *Please* don't skip on the description - this is a learning exercise for everyone!

####How can you help?

Currently you cannot add anything to the project - yet! I am currently doing spikework to see if there is enough enthusiastic people wanting to participate. If you are interested - please don't hesitate to email me at ```sbsherar@gmail.com```. Also keep an eye out here and on my [Github](http://www.github.com/ssherar) to see for any activity on the repo!
