Hi! My name is Sam Sherar and I am currently a fourth year student at the
[University of Aberystwyth, Wales][1] studying MEng. Software Engineering.
However, for the past year I have been working at [General Electric][2] in the
Corporate business as an IT Intern: working on global initiatives and also
developing certain toolkits which are being used today.

##Code

So the question I get asked the most: **Sam! You're a software engineer,
what's your favourite language**. And I have yet to give a difinitive answer to
that question as I have so many! For example, I am proficient in:

 * PHP
 * Python
 * Javascript
 * Java

(and if you have a look at my [github account][github], you can see many projects
which I've worked upon with these languages!)

However, those 4 languages are never enough, so I have got working knowledge in:

  * Objective C/C/C++
  * Ruby
  * C#
  * Bash
  * ... and more will be added throughout the years!
