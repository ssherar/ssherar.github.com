							<p>Welcome to SamSherar.co.uk: the portfolio and online hub of Sam Sherar - a second year Undergrad studying MEng Software Engineering at Aberystwyth University. Computing has been a passion of mine since I was a little nipper playing educational games on Windows 3.1 and my thirst hasn't stopped since!</p>
							<p> My main interests are mainly software side: programming problems and bugs have always facinated me! From websites not displaying correctly, to reducing database sizes, it has always been a great way to challenge myself.</p>
							<p>Some of the programming languages I currently know are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>C</li>
								<li>PHP/MySQL</li>
								<li>xHTML/HTML5/CSS</li>
								<li>Java</li>
								<li>Perl</li>
								<li>Haskell</li>
								<li>C#/VB.NET</li>
							</ul>
							<p> To see more about my skills, please look on my <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#resume" href="#resume" rel="internal">Resume</a></p>

							<h3> Skills </h3>
							<ul class="skills">
								<li><h5>(x)HTML/CSS</h5>
									<p>I have been programming different flavours of HTML and CSS for nearly 10 years now. In that time I have developed both sites for friends and family, as well as a short stint working as a freelancer for several international webhosting companies. I also specialise in creating websites which can be both displayed with or without Javascript (have a look, turn off javascript!).</p>
								</li>
								<li><h5>PHP/MySQL</h5>
								<p>I first started using PHP in 2005 when I wanted to develop dynamic pages and this quickly sparked up my curiousity! Soon enough I had developed my own Content Management System called MoltenCMS, several plugins for IP.Board and several projects using the CakePHP framework. A current project is to create a lightweight IRC bot.</p>
